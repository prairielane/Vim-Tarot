    """Page of Wands - Frequently, this card refers to you, or someone who strongly influences your life in the situation, but does not have to be male.

    """Knight of Wands - Frequently, this card refers to you, or someone who strongly influences your life in the situation, but does not have to be male.

Even his horse is rearing up, raring to go. The energy of this card is that of action and movement. Harness this energy, but remember to ground yourself. You must think clearly to accomplish your goals. Don't get caught up in the situation: take time to think things through before you act.""",
    """King of Swords - The King refers to you, or someone who strongly influences your life in the situation in question, but does not have to be male. He is an authority figure who wears the yellow crown of mental energy. The butterfly on his throne is a symbol of his emergence from a chrysalis: he transforms into the confident King depicted on the card. He has fought many psychological battles, and has gained wisdom, hence his purple mantle. He listens carefully to all sides, basing his judgement on his own experiences, trying to make the fairest decision. The birds flying over him, symbols of Air, fly above it all. Their vantage point offers them an impartial view, just like that of the King. He sometimes appears unapproachable, unfeeling, and cold because of his remote countenance. Apply his view to your current situation.""",
    """King of Cups - The King of Cups directs his creative powers to achieve success. He practices self discipline, sometimes even at the expense of his dreams, to rise to power.

His command of this element, which signifies the Will, is further supported visually by the tiny lizard at his feet. He is a strong-minded individual, sometimes manipulating others through his Will. This forthright person is honest, fiery, and optimistic, and may feel like a natural leader. This energy could be better channelled away from others and into the pursuit of long term goals, especially career-oriented ones.""",

She shows a real lust for life. Do you?""",

The flowers and grapes symbolize the beauty and bounty he enjoys, seated in his garden, reflecting on all his hard work.

His success stems from his passion for his chosen field.""",
