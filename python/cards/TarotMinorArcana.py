    """Nine of Cup - s  Enjoying the fulfillment of desire is indicated by the Nine of Cups. You may be in a place in your life where you are comfortable and happy, and are able to enjoy the many rewards of your past actions. Contentment and luxury are suggested by the imagery of the man, sitting comfortably, enjoying the nine cups arranged on the banquet table. Life is your banquet, and you’ve earned the right to enjoy it. In old tradition, the Nine of Cups is the "Wish Card" and was always thought to mean the fulfillment of one’s innermost desires.""",

However, most often it signifies the successful and speedy completion of a goal.""",
    """Ten of Wands -   Depicting a person over-burdened by a heavy load, the Ten of Wands indicates that you have a lot of irons in the fire—be careful not to get burned!

Choose your challenges wisely, and you will be able to give more of yourself to them.""",
    """Eight of Cups -   The Eight of Cups suggests that you are beginning an important journey of self-exploration. The cups the character in the picture is leaving behind seem organized and stable, though there is a noticeable gap in them. This shows that you have a relatively stable situation that you are leaving behind, but that you feel that there is something more, something your soul is seeking. The moon is shown eclipsing the sun which shows how your search for deeper meaning is blocking out the importance of ordinary daily life. You must climb the mountain to find your spiritual peak. It is said that the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.""",
    """Two of Pentacles -   Juggling two situations at once with ease, the person in the Two of Pentacles personifies the choices we make every day. Like the ships on the rough seas behind him, he has experienced ups and downs in the endless tide of life, symbolized by the infinity sign in the pattern surrounding the pentacles. Every new choice made brings change, a new opportunity, and a fresh start. It is said that the only thing constant is change. You can triumph in this situation if you remain flexible and adapt, rather than resist.""",
    """Seven of Wands -   The Seven of Wands is a card of defense and confrontation. You have been forced to face a conflict head on. You are cornered and have no choice but to confront the source of the present turmoil. While you are successful and respected, there are those around you who would seek to knock you off your throne of position. Your only choices are to forfeit what you've worked for or to fight. Wands represent passion and fire and these are what you feel for your position and what you've accomplished. Use your vantage point at the top of the mountain to strategically plot your next move. This is not a time for compromise. You must adhere to your deeply held beliefs if you want to succeed in the battle.""",

Patience brings prosperity, and the one who has worked hard on this garden now takes pride in its beauty and abundance...good tending yields good results. The floral gate in the background, reminiscent of the ring surrounding the self-actualized person on the World card, can indicate a door of opportunity for new business, property, or other practical assets opening up for you.""",
    """Six of Swords -   The Six of Swords represents a retreat that you are in the process of taking. You have been dealing with heavy stress, signified by the choppy water behind the boat. This card can also indicate that you feel “haunted” by someone or something, and you seek closure. You are in the process of leaving this behind, setting forth for the calmness of still waters. You are learning to balance your mental state, evidenced by the swords that do not fall though the boat is in motion. You are also the protector in the situation. Your loved ones are relying on you to carry them away from troubled waters. You won’t let them down.""",
    """Five of Wands -   Healthy competition is indicated by the Five of Wands. Notice that nobody in the picture is causing harm to another. They are all simply vying for position. This card indicates that you could be in the position for success in business or in the workplace, but that competition could be slowing you down. Are you spending too much time on the weaknesses of others, rather than amplifying your own strengths and good qualities? Competition can often be good and force you to perform at your best level, but don't let it become an obsession for its own sake.""",

Note how the crowd in the card seems to line the street as the man rides through them on his horse: those around you support your efforts, and celebrate your triumph with you. Take a bow!""",
    """Seven of Swords -   The aggressor in the Seven of Swords slyly makes off with many of his enemy’s weapons, taking his opposition down a peg in an underhanded way. He cannot defeat the competition completely this way: some swords remain, evidence that the war is not over yet. He acts alone, indicating that your present situation is a somewhat clandestine one. The warning here is not to get too wrapped up in mental games, one-upmanship, and petty battles that do not solve anything. Take the high road.""",
    """Five of Swords -   The Five of Swords indicates defeat. You may have just lost a battle (most likely a mental one), and find yourself in retreat, seeking to calm the choppy waters of your emotions. The character collecting the swords suggests that a score-keeper, motivated by revenge and vindication, is at the heart of your troubles. This card can also be a warning to you to avoid your own lusts for revenge, showing that only hurt and pain will be the result. Take time to heal your wounds. Concede your defeat and find new things to focus on.""",
    """Four of Swords -   The Four of Swords represents an inner retreat that you are currently taking. Your present situation is very difficult and you may be in the midst of much turmoil. A temporary truce seems to be in place, and you are now seeking recuperation within. The swords on the wall symbolize your previous battles, and the sword at your side represents your current conflict. You will soon take up the sword again. The battle isn’t over, but when you return to it, you’ll be invigorated and able to formulate a mature, effective response. When combined with the Eight of Wands or the Six of Swords, this card can also mean that some kind of an actual trip may take place, one intended to bring you peace of mind.""",
    """Three of Swords -   One of the most disquieting cards of the Tarot is the Three of Swords. The images show three swords penetrating the heart, which implies that you may be going through a state of intense sorrow. This card shows separation, divorce, and perhaps even the harmful intrusion of a third party, as in an extramarital affair. The falling rain seems to enhance the dismal nature of this card, but fear not. From the fall of rain comes growth. You will become stronger from this experience, and your own inner love will shine through.""",
    """Ace of Swords -   In the Ace of Swords, the crowned sword of intellect is held over the mountains, literally denoting the triumph of mind over matter. Truth and honesty prevail, symbolized by the palm of victory, and peace is found, symbolized by the olive branch. Violent acts of force are not necessary to achieve your goals. Your determination and strength of Will have surmounted the obstacles in your path.""",
    """Two of Swords -   The Two of Swords symbolizes a choice. The decision is put off, and the seeker is stuck, unable to face the truth. The blindfold she wears willingly shows her inability to open her eyes to reality. She has chosen to turn away from her intuition and emotions, symbolized by the ocean. She is a passive participant, crossing her arms over her chest to protect her heart. Putting this decision off may buy you time to gain control over your emotions, but the decision will inevitably have to be made, and if you wait, it may be made for you.""",
    """Four of Wands -   The successful completion of projects is indicated by the Four of Wands. The garland hanging from the four wands suggests that your goals were recently achieved. The castle represents the solidity and splendor of what you have created. The characters in the image hold the harvest of their efforts high in the air in celebration of their success. Enjoy the well-earned fruits of completion.""",
    """Ten of Swords -   The swords stuck in the person’s back symbolize failed plans, loss, and defeat, but the sheer number of swords, ten, can indicate over-dramatization of the situation. It probably is not as bad as it seems to the one who is in it. The water is calm, the sky on the horizon is light, and it is the darkest hour that is passing. Soon, the dawn will come, and a new beginning with it, so do not lose hope.""",
    """Six of Pentacles -   A quick glance at the Six of Pentacles shows a generous person giving to those less fortunate. The fact that the giver is standing while the others kneel reveals the deeper meaning. The scales symbolize the balance of power, which benefits both the giver and the receiver to varying degrees in this situation. The person or entity giving bases this generosity on the power it has over those who accept the charity or aid, and this may be mental, emotional, or sexual favors, not necessarily material ones. The person giving could actually be a job, and may be dominating an entire group of people who remain in the situation because they do not want to risk a change. You may find that you are getting what you need, but not what you want, and you must decide if your desires are strong enough to draw you out of your comfort zone.""",
    """Five of Pentacles -   The two unfortunate travelers experience severe hardships: loss of property, income, and health are all indicated in the bleak picture that is the Five of Pentacles. The church in the background is not a refuge for them: either they refuse its charity, do not recognize the opportunity it represents, or find no nourishment there. While a pessimist might focus on what they lack, an optimist would point out that they survive these hard times together, supporting each other. In this case, attitude is everything. Perseverance furthers—your strength lies in those who love you.""",
    """Three of Cups -   The Three of Cups indicates the celebration of friendship, and the joy of being together. You are enjoying time with close friends and remembering the good times that you have shared. Great achievements are toasted among you, suggested by the bountiful harvest at the feet of the women celebrating. This is a time of appreciation of the deeper sense of understanding that you share with your closest friends. It is said that we find few true friends in our lifetime. Treasure yours always.""",
    """Four of Cups -   The Four of Cups indicates a strong sense of emotional retreat and discontent that you are experiencing. The man sitting against the tree seems to be closed off to new ideas. You may be focusing on the boredom you’ve been feeling with what you already have, suggested by the three cups at the man’s feet. A new opportunity is being offered you and you may be turning it down, deciding instead to close yourself off. Perhaps you are in need of this retreat, and need to evaluate what’s important to you, but spending too long in this mode can prevent you from moving forward.""",
    """Eight of Swords -   Oppression is symbolized by the Eight of Swords. You may be feeling trapped and alone, unable to see your way through to a solution. The castle in the background suggests the authority figure that you may feel is keeping you down. The swords are the opposition that is keeping you where you are. Look closer. Could you be keeping yourself there? Notice that the woman in the picture does not have her feet tied, nor are the swords blocking her way. You have been free to go all along. The oppressor in your life may actually be real, but you must not give away your power. You may be feeling that it’s time to move on. Trust your inner voice.""",
    """Nine of Swords -   The depth of mental anguish felt by the person in the Nine of Swords is beyond description. The carving on the bed shows the violence that led to the current situation, and suggests that someone you love may have been involved in the battle. The swords on the wall indicate that you have not been struck directly at this time. Sleepless nights, anxiety dreams, and worry plague you: note that the person sits up, head in hands, crying alone in bed. This body language epitomizes guilt, depression, and despair. There is a need for comfort, emotional shelter, forgiveness, and healing.""",
    """Four of Pentacles -   The Four of Pentacles indicates that you are working to achieve stability through reliance on material gain. You may be blocking yourself from the world around you, symbolized by the character in the image who covers his head, heart, and feet with his wealth, protecting himself from interference from the outside world. What are you afraid of losing, so much that you are hoarding everything you can? You are proving that you are adept at saving money, and you deserve the hard earned financial success you are winning, but once in a while you must take time out to enjoy some of the bounty of your success.""",
    """Three of Wands -   The person depicted in the Three of Wands sends his ships out, staying behind to “hold the fort”. This card can indicate the desire to maintain existing relationships while testing the waters of new ones. In business terms, this is job hunting while you are still gainfully employed; in matters of love, this can indicate the desire to have an affair. Ponder the needs you are looking to fill with whatever you are seeking.""",
    """Two of Wands -   The Two of Wands represents opportunity, especially in business. Perhaps you are in the process of laying the foundation for a new venture. You have achieved some success, indicated by the wand fastened securely to the castle wall. Also note the lilies of purity balanced by the red roses of desire. This shows the balance with which you approach your goal. The wand in one hand represents your undertaking and the globe in the other suggests the tremendous potential for success. The character in the image, looking out to sea, suggests trade and could indicate strong partnerships and alliances. You are in the early stages of a prosperous enterprise.""",
    """Ace of Wands -   All that is best in the suit of Wands is embodied in the Ace: the power of Will, desire, sexuality, and vitality are abundant at this time. Just as the leaves burst forth with such force that they are seen falling from the Wand, your energy brings forth many fertile beginnings. This card symbolizes the healthy, positive outlook that should be held in the present situation. Great things are indicated.""",
    """Ten of Cups -   The Ten of Cups suggests the success of family and emotional fulfillment. The rainbow is the promise of stability and protection, and in the Bible, the rainbow was used as God’s promise that he would never again send a flood of destruction to the earth. You may be in the process of realizing how strong your family is, and what they have done to help create who you are and give you strength. Your current family, if you have one, is growing closer, perhaps after a very trying time. This card can also signify the start of a new family, like a young tree sending its first roots into the ground.""",
    """Ten of Pentacles -   Overall, the Ten of Pentacles is a card of a good home life, security, prosperity, and happiness...on the surface. Looking closer, the family appears not to notice how lucky they are, which is the deeper message of the card. The man and woman do not walk together; rather, they pass each other briefly as they go through their mundane motions. The people in the situation take what they have, and each other, for granted. They are so wrapped up in their daily routines that they do not take the time to acknowledge the magic and blessings around them, symbolized by the ten pentacles surrounding their home. The ten pentacles also have a deeper meaning, echoing the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. This serves as a reminder to look past the trappings of the material world, and seek the blessings of the soul.""",
    """Nine of Pentacles -   The person in the Nine of Pentacles has made her own way, and enjoys freedom within the boundaries she has created for herself. The wall of Pentacles she touches has been created and nurtured by her. She is alone but for her falcon, symbol of the intellect, which she has trained. The bird, like her, enjoys a modicum of freedom within the boundaries of its responsibilities. This person is self-sufficient, and cherishes her private time, her “space”. She has sacrificed adventure and reckless abandon to achieve her goals, and she knows she made the right choice.""",
    """Eight of Pentacles -   Skill and talent combine to form the energy of the Eight of Pentacles. The gentleman works diligently on his project, taking great care to produce quality, not quantity. His attention to detail and genuine love of his work will make him a master someday, but that is not his top priority. He loves his work, and betters himself as a person through it. The road from his workshop to the city in the distance shows his other motivation: doing well for the benefit of the community, not just himself. Stop and examine what you put your energy into, and realize that you derive more pleasure from work that benefits others as well as yourself.""",
    """Seven of Pentacles -   The Seven of Pentacles represents a sense of dissatisfaction that you feel with the results of a project that you’ve recently completed, either in the workplace or in your personal life. What you have planted is bearing fruit, but not quite to your satisfaction. Despite the less than satisfactory results, you are glad that the project is over. You’re grateful that you now have time to relax, but feel that you could have done more. There is much to be thankful for. You have created something that has a life of its own, and it will continue to grow. This card can often be a warning against perfectionism, and a sign that you must sometimes step back and let go.""",
    """Five of Cups -   The Five of Cups suggests that you are upset over a loss or disappointment. The three cups spilled at the man’s feet in the picture indicate the loss you’re experiencing. You may not be aware of the strong support system that remains, indicated by the two cups still standing. Your friends and loved ones are offering their support but you are focusing too much on the disappointment. The river in the image suggests the troubled emotions that are making you feel lost and distant; you are cutting yourself off from the joy and love associated with home. Remember to notice the bridge that isn’t far from view. It can lead you home again, into the arms of your loved ones.""",
    """Six of Cups -   Childhood memories, family gatherings, and friends from the past are all suggested by the Six of Cups. You may be about to encounter a friend or lover from your past that you haven’t seen in many years, if you haven’t already bumped into this person. The child bearing the flowering cup indicates the positive nature of this meeting. The pleasant home in the background is also a strong indicator of family and home. You may be spending more time with family and old friends. Celebrate your past. It is the foundation for your dreams and goals in the future.""",
    """Seven of Cups -   Flights of fancy and daydreaming are indicated by the Seven of Cups. In the picture we see the many visions of happiness that the character sees in the cups, but they are all unrealistic goals at this time: a castle in the clouds, jewels, dragons, and holy figures, among others. You may be experiencing a preoccupation with visions of fantastic goals as a means of escaping an emotional reality you aren’t able to confront. There are real and tangible sources of happiness in your life and those are the things you should treasure. Open up to the love around you.""",

The man and woman facing each other, staring into one another’s eyes, suggest the deeper sense of understanding that exists between them.

You may be currently in the process of finishing a large project that you??ve been working on for some time and are about to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Your competence and desire for perfection are visible in your excellent work. If combined with the Ace of Pentacles, this card can represent earning an academic degree. Either way, you deserve the praise you??ll receive for a job well done.""",
    """Four of Pentacles -   The Four of Pentacles indicates that you are working to achieve stability through reliance on material gain. You may be blocking yourself from the world around you, symbolized by the character in the image who covers his head, heart, and feet with his wealth, protecting himself from interference from the outside world. What are you afraid of losing, so much that you are hoarding everything you can? You are proving that you are adept at saving money, and you deserve the hard earned financial success you are winning, but once in a while you must take time out to enjoy some of the bounty of your success. """,
    """Five of Pentacles -   The two unfortunate travelers experience severe hardships: loss of property, income, and health are all indicated in the bleak picture that is the Five of Pentacles. The church in the background is not a refuge for them: either they refuse its charity, do not recognize the opportunity it represents, or find no nourishment there. While a pessimist might focus on what they lack, an optimist would point out that they survive these hard times together, supporting each other. In this case, attitude is everything. Perseverance furthers??your strength lies in those who love you. """,
    """Six of Pentacles -   A quick glance at the Six of Pentacles shows a generous person giving to those less fortunate. The fact that the giver is standing while the others kneel reveals the deeper meaning. The scales symbolize the balance of power, which benefits both the giver and the receiver to varying degrees in this situation. The person or entity giving bases this generosity on the power it has over those who accept the charity or aid, and this may be mental, emotional, or sexual favors, not necessarily material ones. The person giving could actually be a job, and may be dominating an entire group of people who remain in the situation because they do not want to risk a change. You may find that you are getting what you need, but not what you want, and you must decide if your desires are strong enough to draw you out of your comfort zone. """,
    """Seven of Pentacles -   The Seven of Pentacles represents a sense of dissatisfaction that you feel with the results of a project that you??ve recently completed, either in the workplace or in your personal life. What you have planted is bearing fruit, but not quite to your satisfaction. Despite the less than satisfactory results, you are glad that the project is over. You??re grateful that you now have time to relax, but feel that you could have done more. There is much to be thankful for. You have created something that has a life of its own, and it will continue to grow. This card can often be a warning against perfectionism, and a sign that you must sometimes step back and let go. """,
    """Eight of Pentacles -   Skill and talent combine to form the energy of the Eight of Pentacles. The gentleman works diligently on his project, taking great care to produce quality, not quantity. His attention to detail and genuine love of his work will make him a master someday, but that is not his top priority. He loves his work, and betters himself as a person through it. The road from his workshop to the city in the distance shows his other motivation: doing well for the benefit of the community, not just himself. Stop and examine what you put your energy into, and realize that you derive more pleasure from work that benefits others as well as yourself. """,
    """Nine of Pentacles -   The person in the Nine of Pentacles has made her own way, and enjoys freedom within the boundaries she has created for herself. The wall of Pentacles she touches has been created and nurtured by her. She is alone but for her falcon, symbol of the intellect, which she has trained. The bird, like her, enjoys a modicum of freedom within the boundaries of its responsibilities. This person is self-sufficient, and cherishes her private time, her ??space?. She has sacrificed adventure and reckless abandon to achieve her goals, and she knows she made the right choice. """,
    """Ten of Pentacles -   Overall, the Ten of Pentacles is a card of a good home life, security, prosperity, and happiness...on the surface. Looking closer, the family appears not to notice how lucky they are, which is the deeper message of the card. The man and woman do not walk together rather, they pass each other briefly as they go through their mundane motions. The people in the situation take what they have, and each other, for granted. They are so wrapped up in their daily routines that they do not take the time to acknowledge the magic and blessings around them, symbolized by the ten pentacles surrounding their home. The ten pentacles also have a deeper meaning, echoing the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. This serves as a reminder to look past the trappings of the material world, and seek the blessings of the soul. """,

    """Ace of Swords -   In the Ace of Swords, the crowned sword of intellect is held over the mountains, literally denoting the triumph of mind over matter. Truth and honesty prevail, symbolized by the palm of victory, and peace is found, symbolized by the olive branch. Violent acts of force are not necessary to achieve your goals. Your determination and strength of Will have surmounted the obstacles in your path. """,
    """Two of Swords -   The Two of Swords symbolizes a choice. The decision is put off, and the seeker is stuck, unable to face the truth. The blindfold she wears willingly shows her inability to open her eyes to reality. She has chosen to turn away from her intuition and emotions, symbolized by the ocean. She is a passive participant, crossing her arms over her chest to protect her heart. Putting this decision off may buy you time to gain control over your emotions, but the decision will inevitably have to be made, and if you wait, it may be made for you. """,
    """Three of Swords -   One of the most disquieting cards of the Tarot is the Three of Swords. The images show three swords penetrating the heart, which implies that you may be going through a state of intense sorrow. This card shows separation, divorce, and perhaps even the harmful intrusion of a third party, as in an extramarital affair. The falling rain seems to enhance the dismal nature of this card, but fear not. From the fall of rain comes growth. You will become stronger from this experience, and your own inner love will shine through. """,
    """Four of Swords -   The Four of Swords represents an inner retreat that you are currently taking. Your present situation is very difficult and you may be in the midst of much turmoil. A temporary truce seems to be in place, and you are now seeking recuperation within. The swords on the wall symbolize your previous battles, and the sword at your side represents your current conflict. You will soon take up the sword again. The battle isn??t over, but when you return to it, you??ll be invigorated and able to formulate a mature, effective response. When combined with the Eight of Wands or the Six of Swords, this card can also mean that some kind of an actual trip may take place, one intended to bring you peace of mind. """,
    """Five of Swords -   The Five of Swords indicates defeat. You may have just lost a battle (most likely a mental one), and find yourself in retreat, seeking to calm the choppy waters of your emotions. The character collecting the swords suggests that a score-keeper, motivated by revenge and vindication, is at the heart of your troubles. This card can also be a warning to you to avoid your own lusts for revenge, showing that only hurt and pain will be the result. Take time to heal your wounds. Concede your defeat and find new things to focus on. """,
    """Six of Swords -   The Six of Swords represents a retreat that you are in the process of taking. You have been dealing with heavy stress, signified by the choppy water behind the boat. This card can also indicate that you feel ??haunted? by someone or something, and you seek closure. You are in the process of leaving this behind, setting forth for the calmness of still waters. You are learning to balance your mental state, evidenced by the swords that do not fall though the boat is in motion. You are also the protector in the situation. Your loved ones are relying on you to carry them away from troubled waters. You won??t let them down. """,
    """Seven of Swords -   The aggressor in the Seven of Swords slyly makes off with many of his enemy??s weapons, taking his opposition down a peg in an underhanded way. He cannot defeat the competition completely this way: some swords remain, evidence that the war is not over yet. He acts alone, indicating that your present situation is a somewhat clandestine one. The warning here is not to get too wrapped up in mental games, one-upmanship, and petty battles that do not solve anything. Take the high road. """,
    """Eight of Swords -   Oppression is symbolized by the Eight of Swords. You may be feeling trapped and alone, unable to see your way through to a solution. The castle in the background suggests the authority figure that you may feel is keeping you down. The swords are the opposition that is keeping you where you are. Look closer. Could you be keeping yourself there? Notice that the woman in the picture does not have her feet tied, nor are the swords blocking her way. You have been free to go all along. The oppressor in your life may actually be real, but you must not give away your power. You may be feeling that it??s time to move on. Trust your inner voice. """,
    """Nine of Swords -   The depth of mental anguish felt by the person in the Nine of Swords is beyond description. The carving on the bed shows the violence that led to the current situation, and suggests that someone you love may have been involved in the battle. The swords on the wall indicate that you have not been struck directly at this time. Sleepless nights, anxiety dreams, and worry plague you: note that the person sits up, head in hands, crying alone in bed. This body language epitomizes guilt, depression, and despair. There is a need for comfort, emotional shelter, forgiveness, and healing. """,
    """Ten of Swords -   The swords stuck in the person??s back symbolize failed plans, loss, and defeat, but the sheer number of swords, ten, can indicate over-dramatization of the situation. It probably is not as bad as it seems to the one who is in it. The water is calm, the sky on the horizon is light, and it is the darkest hour that is passing. Soon, the dawn will come, and a new beginning with it, so do not lose hope. """,
