    """Ace of Pentacles -   The hand in the Ace of Pentacles bestows its blessings in a garden full of a variety of delights. Earth??s bounty is physical and comes in the form of tangible pleasures. Patience brings prosperity, and the one who has worked hard on this garden now takes pride in its beauty and abundance...good tending yields good results. The floral gate in the background, reminiscent of the ring surrounding the self-actualized person on the World card, can indicate a door of opportunity for new business, property, or other practical assets opening up for you. """,
    """Two of Pentacles -   Juggling two situations at once with ease, the person in the Two of Pentacles personifies the choices we make every day. Like the ships on the rough seas behind him, he has experienced ups and downs in the endless tide of life, symbolized by the infinity sign in the pattern surrounding the pentacles. Every new choice made brings change, a new opportunity, and a fresh start. It is said that the only thing constant is change. You can triumph in this situation if you remain flexible and adapt, rather than resist. """,
    """Three of Pentacles -   The Three of Pentacles is a card of Mastery. The craftsman in the image is proud of his work and is happy to display it to others. You may be currently in the process of finishing a large project that you??ve been working on for some time and are about to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Your competence and desire for perfection are visible in your excellent work. If combined with the Ace of Pentacles, this card can represent earning an academic degree. Either way, you deserve the praise you??ll receive for a job well done.""",
    """Four of Pentacles -   The Four of Pentacles indicates that you are working to achieve stability through reliance on material gain. You may be blocking yourself from the world around you, symbolized by the character in the image who covers his head, heart, and feet with his wealth, protecting himself from interference from the outside world. What are you afraid of losing, so much that you are hoarding everything you can? You are proving that you are adept at saving money, and you deserve the hard earned financial success you are winning, but once in a while you must take time out to enjoy some of the bounty of your success. """,
    """Five of Pentacles -   The two unfortunate travelers experience severe hardships: loss of property, income, and health are all indicated in the bleak picture that is the Five of Pentacles. The church in the background is not a refuge for them: either they refuse its charity, do not recognize the opportunity it represents, or find no nourishment there. While a pessimist might focus on what they lack, an optimist would point out that they survive these hard times together, supporting each other. In this case, attitude is everything. Perseverance furthers??your strength lies in those who love you. """,
    """Six of Pentacles -   A quick glance at the Six of Pentacles shows a generous person giving to those less fortunate. The fact that the giver is standing while the others kneel reveals the deeper meaning. The scales symbolize the balance of power, which benefits both the giver and the receiver to varying degrees in this situation. The person or entity giving bases this generosity on the power it has over those who accept the charity or aid, and this may be mental, emotional, or sexual favors, not necessarily material ones. The person giving could actually be a job, and may be dominating an entire group of people who remain in the situation because they do not want to risk a change. You may find that you are getting what you need, but not what you want, and you must decide if your desires are strong enough to draw you out of your comfort zone. """,
    """Seven of Pentacles -   The Seven of Pentacles represents a sense of dissatisfaction that you feel with the results of a project that you??ve recently completed, either in the workplace or in your personal life. What you have planted is bearing fruit, but not quite to your satisfaction. Despite the less than satisfactory results, you are glad that the project is over. You??re grateful that you now have time to relax, but feel that you could have done more. There is much to be thankful for. You have created something that has a life of its own, and it will continue to grow. This card can often be a warning against perfectionism, and a sign that you must sometimes step back and let go. """,
    """Eight of Pentacles -   Skill and talent combine to form the energy of the Eight of Pentacles. The gentleman works diligently on his project, taking great care to produce quality, not quantity. His attention to detail and genuine love of his work will make him a master someday, but that is not his top priority. He loves his work, and betters himself as a person through it. The road from his workshop to the city in the distance shows his other motivation: doing well for the benefit of the community, not just himself. Stop and examine what you put your energy into, and realize that you derive more pleasure from work that benefits others as well as yourself. """,
    """Nine of Pentacles -   The person in the Nine of Pentacles has made her own way, and enjoys freedom within the boundaries she has created for herself. The wall of Pentacles she touches has been created and nurtured by her. She is alone but for her falcon, symbol of the intellect, which she has trained. The bird, like her, enjoys a modicum of freedom within the boundaries of its responsibilities. This person is self-sufficient, and cherishes her private time, her ??space?. She has sacrificed adventure and reckless abandon to achieve her goals, and she knows she made the right choice. """,
    """Ten of Pentacles -   Overall, the Ten of Pentacles is a card of a good home life, security, prosperity, and happiness...on the surface. Looking closer, the family appears not to notice how lucky they are, which is the deeper message of the card. The man and woman do not walk together rather, they pass each other briefly as they go through their mundane motions. The people in the situation take what they have, and each other, for granted. They are so wrapped up in their daily routines that they do not take the time to acknowledge the magic and blessings around them, symbolized by the ten pentacles surrounding their home. The ten pentacles also have a deeper meaning, echoing the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life. This serves as a reminder to look past the trappings of the material world, and seek the blessings of the soul. """,
